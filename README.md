# ICT 606: Machine Learning 
# Project-2-NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Topic-Modelling-in-US-Airline-Tweets (Python)

Objective: This project involved analyzing customer feedback from tweets about US airlines using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Python libraries such as NLTK were used for essential text preprocessing tasks, including lemmatization and tokenization, to clean and prepare the data, which often contains messy customer reviews.

The project included Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using TF-IDF for feature extraction and employed transformer-based models like BERTopic for topic modeling. A comparison was made between these methods and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), evaluating the models using performance metrics such as the silhouette score to assess clustering quality.

Learning Outcome: Through sentiment analysis, airlines can gain valuable insights from customer reviews, identifying key sentiments and concerns. This enables organizations to engage with customers more effectively, address internal inefficiencies, and ultimately improve the overall customer experience. The project highlighted how sentiment analysis and topic modeling can drive better decision-making in customer relations.
